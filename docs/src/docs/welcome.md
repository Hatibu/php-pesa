# Welcome to Pesa PHP SDK

Pesa PHP SDK is an Software Development Kit - a toolkit - for people who build apps using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to intergrate OpenAPI much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of function for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. Pesa SDK lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

Where possible, Pesa SDK has been kept as flexible as possible, allowing you to work in the way you want, not being forced into working any certain way. The library can have core parts easily extended or completely replaced to make the system work the way you need it to. In short, Pesa PHP SDK is the malleable framework that tries to provide the tools you need while staying out of the way.
